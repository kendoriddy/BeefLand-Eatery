# BeefLand Menu

The BeefLand web application displays a list of meals that were provided by an external [API](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=beef). The users can like a meal, leave some comments or make a reservation, in these cases an involvement API was used.

N.B. The reservation functions are not implemented because there are just two in the group.

This is the second Microverse capstone project meant to summarize all the content learned through module 2. The objective was to mimic the appearance of a dynamic web application, in a similar way a web developer would receive the requirements as if it were in a job.

## Project requirements

## How it works

The BeefLand web application allows users to like, comment, and make a reservation for their favorite meal.
* By clicking on `like button` the number of like is increased and stored in the involvement API;
* By clicking on the `Comment button` to display the description of the selected meal, the list of all comments, and added a new comment;
* By clicking on the `Reservation button` to display the list of all reservations and make a new Reservation;
